    <h2>About movrm</h2>
    <p>
      movrm is more than just a running community – it’s a shared movement of mind over matter, where motivation meets movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded in 2025, movrm was born from the belief that running isn’t just a physical pursuit – it’s a mindset. A discipline. A daily recommitment to oneself. movrm exists to help runners, both new and experienced, harness that mindset – not through metrics or medals, but through movement made meaningful by community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re lacing up for your first 5k or training for a half marathon, movrm is your virtual running family. It’s a space where motivation battles doubt and determination crushes fatigue.
