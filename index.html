    <h2>What is MOVRM?</h2>
    <p>
      MOVRM is a remote-first, community-powered running platform designed to help new runners stay consistent, accountable and motivated – all through the power of real-time running invitations and community support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's how MOVRM works: you sign up, join a group, and begin to receive live running invitations from your group's host – like "Let's run 5K at 7PM tonight." When you "Commit" to the run, you're not just running alone – you're running with others, as part of your community. After each run, you "Check In", share your progress, and celebrate the effort together.
